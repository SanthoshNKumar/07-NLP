    "Text Classification is the task of assigning the right label to a given piece of text. This text can either be a phrase, a sentence or even a paragraph. Our aim would be to take in some text as input and attach or assign a label to it. Since we will be using Tensor Flow Is deep learning library, we can call this the Tensorflow text classification system"

    "This task involves training a neural network with lots of data indicating what a piece of text represents. I am sure you would have heard of the term “Sentiment Analysis“. Well, sentiment analysis a text classification task but it is restricted only to identify the sentiment of the person saying something. For example, the sentence, ” The food was amazing” has a positive sentiment. On the other hand, ” the movie was horrible” has a negative sentiment while the sentence “sun rises from the east” has a neutral sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentiment analysis, the labels are positive, negative and neutral most of the times. But, this is just one use of the text classification. If you are building other text-based applications like a chatbot, or a document parsing algorithm, you might want to know what a particular sentence belongs to. For example: ” Hello! how are you?” can have the label “Greeting” attached to it or the sentence ” It was a pleasure meeting you” can have the label “Farewell” attached to it."
